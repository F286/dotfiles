# Dotfiles with GNU Stow

This repository contains my personal dotfiles managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), a symlink farm manager that makes it easy to manage your configuration files across different machines and operating systems.

## How Stow Works

GNU Stow creates symlinks from your home directory to the configuration files in this repository:

- **Package**: Each subdirectory in `dotfiles/` is a "package" (e.g., `shell`, `devtools`, `nvim`)
- **Target**: Your home directory (`~` or `$HOME`)
- **Symlinks**: Stow creates symlinks in your home directory pointing to files in the packages

### Package Organization

Packages are organized logically to reduce complexity:

- **`shell`**: All shell-related configs (bash, zsh, tmux) in one package
- **`devtools`**: Development tools (git, lazygit, starship, vimium) in one package
- **`Code`**: VS Code configuration files
- **`nvim`**: Neovim configuration and plugins
- **`kitty`**: Kitty terminal emulator settings
- **`lf`**: LF file manager configuration

### Example

When you run `stow shell` from `dotfiles/common/`:

```
~/.bashrc ‚Üí ~/dotfiles/dotfiles/common/shell/.bashrc
~/.zshrc ‚Üí ~/dotfiles/dotfiles/common/shell/.zshrc
~/.tmux.conf ‚Üí ~/dotfiles/dotfiles/common/shell/.tmux.conf
```

## Quick Install

### Mac

```sh
# Install Homebrew from https://brew.sh if it's not already present
brew install stow
git clone https://github.com/skyde/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./init.sh
```

### Linux

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y stow git
git clone https://github.com/skyde/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./init.sh
```

### Windows

```ps
winget install stefansundin.gnu-stow
git clone https://github.com/skyde/dotfiles.git "$env:USERPROFILE\dotfiles"
cd "$env:USERPROFILE\dotfiles"
./init.ps1
```

## What the Init Scripts Do

The init scripts provide complete automation:

1. **üìÅ Stow Configuration Files**: Symlink all dotfiles to correct locations
2. **üîß Install VS Code Extensions**: Auto-install 7 essential extensions from `vscode_extensions.txt`
3. **üì¶ Install Development Tools**: Optionally install common CLI tools:
   - **macOS**: ripgrep, fd, fzf, bat, delta, eza, neovim, tmux, git, lazygit
   - **Linux**: ripgrep, fd-find, fzf, bat, git, neovim, tmux
   - **Windows**: Git, ripgrep, fd, bat, delta, Neovim, PowerShell

### Non-Interactive Mode

For automated setups (CI/CD, scripts):

```bash
# Skip app installation prompts
AUTO_INSTALL=0 ./init.sh

# Auto-install apps without prompting
AUTO_INSTALL=1 ./init.sh
```

```powershell
# Windows equivalent
$env:AUTO_INSTALL = "0"  # or "1" to auto-install
./init.ps1
```

## Manual Package Management

You can also manage individual packages manually:

### Installing Packages

```sh
cd ~/dotfiles/dotfiles/common

# Install individual packages
stow shell         # Install shell configs (bash, zsh, tmux)
stow devtools      # Install development tools (git, lazygit, starship)
stow nvim          # Install neovim configuration
stow Code          # Install VS Code configuration
stow kitty         # Install kitty terminal configuration
stow lf            # Install lf file manager configuration

# Install macOS-specific configs (on Mac)
cd ../mac
stow hammerspoon   # Install Hammerspoon config
```

### Uninstalling Packages

```sh
cd ~/dotfiles/dotfiles/common

# Remove symlinks for specific packages
stow -D shell      # Remove shell configurations
stow -D devtools   # Remove development tools
```

### Restowing (Update Existing)

```sh
cd ~/dotfiles/dotfiles/common

# Update existing installations after changes
stow -R nvim       # Restow neovim configuration
stow -R devtools   # Restow development tools
```

## Platform-Specific Instructions

### macOS

The init script will:

- Install packages from `dotfiles/common/`
- Install macOS-specific configs from `dotfiles/mac/`
- Optionally install CLI tools (ripgrep, fd, bat, eza, etc.)

### Linux

The init script will:

- Install packages from `dotfiles/common/`
- Set up Linux-specific configurations
- Optionally install CLI tools via package manager

### Windows

The PowerShell script will:

- Install packages from `dotfiles/common/`
- Install Windows-specific configs from `dotfiles/windows/`
- Use PowerShell-compatible stow commands
- Optionally install CLI tools via winget

## Customization

### Adding New Configurations

1. Create a new directory in `dotfiles/common/` (or platform-specific directory)
2. Structure it exactly as it would appear in your home directory
3. Use stow to install it:

```sh
# Example: Adding a new tool called 'mytool'
mkdir -p dotfiles/common/mytool/.config/mytool
echo "config=value" > dotfiles/common/mytool/.config/mytool/config.toml
cd dotfiles/common
stow mytool
```

**Or add to existing packages:**

```sh
# Add to devtools package
echo "new-config=value" > dotfiles/common/devtools/.config/newtool/config.yml
cd dotfiles/common
stow -R devtools  # Restow to pick up new files
```

### Handling Conflicts

If stow encounters existing files that aren't symlinks, it will warn you:

```sh
# Move existing files to backup
mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.backup
mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup

# Then install the package
stow shell
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Stow conflicts**: Remove or backup existing files first
2. **Permission errors**: Ensure you have write access to your home directory
3. **Broken symlinks**: Run `stow -R <package>` to restow
4. **Package not found**: Check you're in the correct directory (`dotfiles/common/` etc.)

## Starship Prompt

Starship is offered as an optional tool.
You'll be prompted to install it unless `AUTO_INSTALL=1` is set, in which case it installs and updates without prompting (winget: `Starship.Starship`).

## Fast CLI Tools

These tools are offered during setup:

- `ripgrep` for searching directories quickly
- `fd` as a faster `find`
- `bat` as a colorful `cat`
- `eza` as an improved `ls`
- `lf` as a modern terminal file manager
- `delta` for modern git diffs (also used in Lazygit)
  - diffs are side-by-side by default, while LazyGit shows inline changes
- `lazygit` for a simple git TUI

# Mac

## Custom Alt Tab

I use the 'Alt Tab' program for easy window switching.

Activate with footpedal + r. Navigate with arrow keys and space to select.

## Hammerspoon

Spotlight opens when the Cmd key is quickly tapped by itself. A short delay prevents accidental triggers.

## Fluor

Automatically switches mode of fn keys per program. Important as keyboard macros use F... keys.

## Better Display

Allows increased brightness when viewing SDR content on an HDR monitor.

# Windows

## Config

```
- To get the Alt Tab switcher to work better
    - Go to Accessibility -> Visual Effects -> Animation effects & turn them off
    - Without this, moving to another tab requires waiting a split second.
- Set cursor blink rate to 0
- Set cursor thickness to 6
```

lf expects its configuration under `%AppData%\lf` on Windows. These dotfiles create a symlink to `~/.config/lf` so settings apply across OSes.

## Powershell 7

Use this since it's nicer than the default one.

## Visual Studio

```
- For Visual Studio use VSVim with the provided vsvimrc
- Using the plugin 'Peasy Motion' with the following settings:
- Allowed jump label characters: tsraneiodhgmplfuc,bjvk
    - (note this is optimized for Colemak Mod DH)
- Use a plugin called MinimalVS for nice fullscreen mode
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pavonism.minimalVS
- There is a plugin called 'Smooth Caret' which messes with the VSVim caret - make sure it's disabled
```

## Perforce

Ensure you set the correct environment variable to allow the diff to work:

```
P4DIFF="C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe" /Diff %1 %2
```

# Visual Studio Code

I'm using a few plugins:

- Vim
- Fzf Picker (hooks into fzf, rg & bat)
- clangd for C++ language features
  Extensions listed in `vscode_extensions.txt` will be installed automatically
  when these dotfiles are applied. Custom keybindings are documented in
  [`docs/vscode-keybindings.md`](docs/vscode-keybindings.md).
  On macOS, the install script also checks for the default CLI at
  `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code` if the
  `code` command isn't in your `PATH`.

For remote development, install the **Remote - SSH** extension. Add your server
details to `~/.ssh/config`, e.g.

```ssh
Host devbox
  HostName server.example.com
  User you
```

Use the ‚ÄúRemote-SSH: Connect to Host‚Ä¶‚Äù command in VS Code to start a session.

# Keyboard

Run `kinesis-advantage2/sync-kinesis-layouts.ps1` with the Kinesis Advantage2 V-Drive connected & key bindings will auto sync.

I've had issues where the keyboard drive gets totally corrupted when syncing from Mac - so just stick to Windows.

For more detail see the 'Interaction' repo.

## Macro Bindings

```

build and run - Shift F2
find class - Shift F3
scroll up - Shift F4
scroll down - Shift F6
stop build - Shift F7
goto definition - Shift F8
open spotlight - tap Cmd
toggle eye mouse - Shift F10
toggle comment - Shift F11

```

## Platforms

Press Pgrm 1 to activate on Mac
Press Pgrm qwerty to activate on Windows

Note you should always leave the keyboard in 'Windows' mode as the bindings have been manually translated.

# Footpedal

The config for the footpedal is located under the savant-elite2 folder.

The pedal config:

- Left is Escape
- Middle is Left Click
- Right is Right Click

The method to open V-Drive is either:

- Flip the switch on the bottom of the pedal
- Hold the pedal down briefly while connecting to the computer (waterproof version)
